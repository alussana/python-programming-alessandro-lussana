### Simple Hidden Markov Model implementation in pandas
### Main features:
### Hmm object are built using parameters stored in external files (csv)
### An existing model can be trained with Baum-Welsch algorithm using TrainingSet objects
### Sequence objects are build from external files (fasta or plain text)
### Optimal hidden paths given a sequence and a model can be found with viterbi decoding
### Sequences can be generated given a model and a path
### Work is in progress
